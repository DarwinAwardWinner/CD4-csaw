# Preliminary Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, retina=2, cache=TRUE, autodep=TRUE,
                      cache.extra = list(params=params),
                      fig.height=8, fig.width=8,
                      cache.path = here::here("cache", "rnaseq-gst"))
```

First we load the necessary libraries, along with a set of utility functions.

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(here)
library(stringr)
library(magrittr)
library(openxlsx)
library(dplyr)
library(tibble)
library(limma)
library(GSEABase)
library(rctutils)


library(BiocParallel)
library(future)
options(future.globals.maxSize=4 * 1024^3)
use_futures("multicore")

# Tell graphite not to use its own parallel logic
options(Ncpus=1)
```

We also set the random seed for reproducibility:

```{r set_random_seed}
set.seed(1986)
```

# Data Loading and Preprocessing

## Loading the RNA-seq differential expression results

We begin by loading the saved data from the RNA-seq differential expression tests. We will use the computed t statistics for all the single-contrast tests. (ANOVA-like tests are skipped.)

```{r load_diffexp_results}
diffexp <- load.in.new.env(here('saved_data', 'RNA-seq', glue_data(params, '{quant_method}_{genome}_{transcriptome}-diffexp.rda')))

elist.cb <- diffexp$elist.cb
design <- diffexp$design
single.contrast.tests <- diffexp$alltests %>% .[lengths(.) == 1]
```

We also need to load the gene sets representing TFBS overlap with gene promoters.

## Loading the TFBS overlap sets

We load the TFBS overlap data for all peaks. For RNA-seq genes, we say that a gene has a TFBS if any of its peaks overlap one.

```{r load_tfbs_overlap}
overlap_sets <- readRDS(here("saved_data", glue_data(params, "promoter-tfbs-overlap_{genome}_{transcriptome}.RDS")))
overlap_sets$RNA <- bplapply(names(overlap_sets[[1]]), function(tf) {
    lapply(overlap_sets, . %>% .[[tf]] %>% str_replace("-P[0-9]+$", "")) %>%
        unlist %>% sort %>% unique
}) %>% set_names(names(overlap_sets[[1]]))
```

## Loading MSigDB gene sets

```{r load_msigdb}
msigdb <- readRDS(here("saved_data", "msigdb-ensembl.RDS")) %>%
    # MSigDB collections of interest
    .[c("h", "c2.CP", "c2.CGP", "c3.MIR", "c3.TFT", "c5", "c7")]
msigdb_gene_sets <- lapply(msigdb, geneIds)
```

## Loading graphite pathway gene sets

```{r load_graphite}
graphite_pathways <- readRDS(here("saved_data", "graphite-ensembl.RDS"))
graphite_gene_sets <- do.call(c, bplapply(graphite_pathways, lapply, . %>% nodes %>% str_replace("^[A-Z]+:", "")))
# Merge gene sets with the same name
graphite_gene_sets %<>% split(names(.)) %>% lapply(. %>% unname %>% unlist)
```

## Collect all gene sets

```{r collect_all_gene_sets}
all_collections <- c(MSigDB=msigdb_gene_sets,
                     list(graphite=graphite_gene_sets),
                     list(TFBS_overlap=overlap_sets$RNA))
```
# Run the CAMERA gene set test

We now run the CAMERA gene set test on all the TFBS overlap sets. We run CAMERA on each single-contrast differential expression test that was run.

```{r run_camera}
camera.results <- lapply(all_collections, function(coll) {
    bplapply(single.contrast.tests, function(ct) {
        camera(elist.cb, index=ids2indices(coll, elist.cb$genes$ENSEMBL),
               design=design, contrast=makeContrasts(contrasts = ct, levels=design)) %>%
            rownames_to_column("GeneSet")
    })
})
```

# Save the result tables

We save one xlsx file for each Gene set collection, with a sheet for each contrast in each file. In each sheet, we keep all gene sets with FDR <= 0.1, or the top 100 gene sets, whichever is more.

```{r save_results}
dir.create(here("results", "RNA-seq"), recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
for (i in names(camera.results)) {
    sig.results <- camera.results[[i]] %>%
        lapply(. %>% filter(FDR <= 0.1 | seq_along(FDR) <= 100))
    write.xlsx(sig.results, here("results", "RNA-seq", glue("CAMERA-results-{i}.xlsx")))
}
saveRDS(camera.results, here("saved_data", "CAMERA-results-RNA.RDS"))
```
