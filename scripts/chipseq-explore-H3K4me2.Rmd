# Preliminary Setup

```{r setup, include=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, retina=2, cache=TRUE, autodep=TRUE,
                      cache.extra = list(params=params), 
                      # https://github.com/yihui/knitr/issues/572
                      cache.lazy=FALSE,
                      fig.height=8, fig.width=8,
                      cache.path = paste0(file.path(params$basedir, "cache", "chipseq-explore", params$histone_mark), .Platform$file.sep))
```

First we load the necessary libraries, along with a set of utility functions.

```{r load_packages, message=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
library(stringr)
library(magrittr)
library(openxlsx)
library(SummarizedExperiment)
library(dplyr)
library(edgeR)
library(limma)
library(csaw)
library(sva)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
library(GGally)
library(ggalt)
library(ggthemes)
library(splines)
library(reshape2)
library(assertthat)
library(ggfortify)
library(broom)
library(ks)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(Rtsne)
library(variancePartition)

library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)

library(doParallel)
ncores <- getOption("mc.cores", default=parallel::detectCores(logical = FALSE))
options(mc.cores=ncores)
registerDoParallel(cores=ncores)
library(BiocParallel)
register(DoparParam())

options(future.globals.maxSize=4 * 1024^3)
library(future)
plan(multicore)

source(file.path(params$basedir, "scripts/utilities.R"))

# Required in order to use DGEList objects with future
length.DGEList <- function(x) {
    length(unclass(x))
}
```

We also set the random seed for reproducibility:

```{r set_random_seed}
set.seed(1986)
```

# Data Loading and Preprocessing

First we load the consensus peaks called from the reads pooled from all samples. This consensus peak set is not biased toward or against any sample or condition, and therefore the peak significance is expected to be independent of any differential binding in that peak.

```{r load_peaks}
peakfile <- file.path(
    params$basedir, "peak_calls", "epic_hg38.analysisSet",
    str_c(params$histone_mark, "_condition.ALL_donor.ALL"),
    "peaks_noBL_IDR.narrowPeak")
allpeaks <- {
    read.narrowPeak(peakfile) %>% as("GRanges") %>%
        assign_into(seqinfo(.), seqinfo(BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38)[seqlevels(.)])
}
```

Now we'll load the ChIP-seq read count data set from RDS files containing SummarizedExperiment objects, and modify them to use the sample names as column names. We also ensure that the column order is identical between the two objects. Lastly, we filter out any windows with fewer than one count per sample. This is a very mild filtering criterion, but it often eliminates many windows, greatly easing the subsequent computational burden of computing the *real* filtering threshold.

```{r load_counts}
sexpfile <- 
    file.path(params$basedir, "saved_data",
              with(params, sprintf("csaw-counts_%s-windows_%s-reads_%s.RDS", window_size, fragment_length, histone_mark)))
bigbin.sexpfile <- file.path(params$basedir, "saved_data",
                             with(params, sprintf("csaw-counts_%s-bigbins_%s.RDS", bigbin_size, histone_mark)))
bigbin.sexp <- readRDS(bigbin.sexpfile)
full.sexp <- readRDS(sexpfile)
colnames(full.sexp) <- colData(full.sexp)$SampleName
colnames(bigbin.sexp) <- colData(bigbin.sexp)$SampleName
# Ensure identical column order
bigbin.sexp %<>% .[,colnames(full.sexp)]
assert_that(all(colnames(full.sexp) == colnames(bigbin.sexp)))
sexp <- full.sexp %>% .[rowSums(assay(.)) >= ncol(.),]
# Exepected number of counts per read, based on overlapping multiple windows. 
# NOTE: Assumes windows exactly tile the genome (no overlaps, no gaps).
colData(sexp)$CountDupFactor <- (colData(sexp)$ext - 1) / median(width(rowRanges(sexp))) + 1
```

We extract the sample metadata from the SummarizedExperiment. We set all factors to use a sum-to-zero variant of the treatment-contrast coding, which will ease the subtraction of batch effects later.

```{r extract_samplemeta}
sample.table <- colData(sexp) %>%
    as.data.frame %>% autoFactorize %>%
    mutate(days_after_activation=time_point %>% str_extract("\\d+$") %>% as.numeric(),
           time_point=factor(days_after_activation) %>% `levels<-`(sprintf("D%s", levels(.))),
           group=interaction(cell_type, time_point, sep="")) %>% 
    autoFactorize %>%
    set_rownames(colnames(sexp))
for (i in names(sample.table)) {
    if (is.factor(sample.table[[i]]) && nlevels(sample.table[[i]]) > 1) {
        sample.table[[i]] %<>% C(code_control_named(levels(.)))
    }
}
```

# Peak and Window Filtering

We begin by selecting only peaks  with an IDR value of 0.05 or less.
```{r initial_filter_peaks}
idr.threshold <- 0.05
genome.size <- seqlengths(seqinfo(allpeaks)) %>% as.numeric %>% sum
peaks <- allpeaks[allpeaks$qValue >= -log10(idr.threshold)]
pct.covered <- width(peaks) %>% sum %>% divide_by(genome.size) %>% multiply_by(100)
mean.pct.reads <- sexp %>% subsetByOverlaps(peaks) %>% assay("counts") %>%
    colSums %>% divide_by(colData(sexp) %$% {totals * CountDupFactor}) %>% multiply_by(100) %>%
    mean
message(sprintf("Selected %i peaks at an IDR threshold of %.3g, with an average width of %.0f nucleotides and covering a total of %.3g%% of the genome, containing on average %.3g%% of reads", length(peaks), idr.threshold, mean(width(peaks)), pct.covered, mean.pct.reads))
```

Now we need a strategy to filter out uninformative windows representing background regions of the genome where no specific binding is observed. First, we examine the overall distribution of average logCPM values, as well as the average logCPM distribution within called peaks:

```{r compute_aveLogCPM}
a %<-% aveLogCPM(asDGEList(sexp), prior.count = 2)
peak.overlap <- overlapsAny(sexp, peaks)
a.peaks <- a[peak.overlap]
```

```{r plot_aveLogCPM}
adata <- data.frame(logCPM=a, PeakOverlap=peak.overlap)
p <- list(
    Histogram=ggplot(adata) +
        aes(x=logCPM, fill=PeakOverlap) +
        geom_histogram(aes(y=100*(..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth=0.1, boundary=0) +
        xlab("Average logCPM") + ylab("Percent of windows in bin") +
        coord_cartesian(xlim=quantile(a, c(0, 0.999)), ylim=c(0,3)) +
        labs(title="Histogram of average window logCPM values",
             subtitle="Colored by peak overlap"),
    Violin=ggplot(adata) +
        aes(x=PeakOverlap, y=logCPM) +
        geom_violin(aes(fill=PeakOverlap), scale = "area") +
        geom_boxplot(width = 0.07, fill = "grey", alpha=0.75, outlier.alpha = 0) +
        scale_fill_hue(guide="none") + 
        coord_cartesian(ylim=quantile(a, c(0, 0.999))) +
        labs(title="Violin plot of average window logCPM values",
             subtitle="Grouped by peak overlap"))
ggprint(p)
summary(lm(logCPM ~ PeakOverlap, data=adata))
```

From the linear model and violin plot, we can see that peaks are clearly significantly enriched for high-abundance windows relative to background regions. However, the histogram shows that a purely count-based filter is not desirable, because any threshold still leaves substantial high-count windows that do no overlap peaks.This is because the peaks represent only a small fraction of the genome and the random variation in background coverage depth is at least as large as the difference between peaks and unbound regions. Hence, we will simply select all windows that overlap called peaks. For this purpose, we will select a larger set of peaks using a more relaxed IDR threshold in order to maximize the probability of including peaks that are present in only one or a few conditions and are therefore more weakly represented in the all-sample consensus. The trade-off of including more false positive peaks is acceptable here, since false positive peaks are not expected to show evidence of differential binding.

```{r filter_peaks}
idr.threshold <- 0.2
peaks <- allpeaks[allpeaks$qValue >= -log10(idr.threshold)]
pct.covered <- width(peaks) %>% sum %>% divide_by(genome.size) %>% multiply_by(100)
mean.pct.reads <- sexp %>% subsetByOverlaps(peaks) %>% assay("counts") %>%
    colSums %>% divide_by(colData(sexp) %$% {totals * CountDupFactor}) %>% multiply_by(100) %>%
    mean
message(sprintf("Selected %i peaks at an IDR threshold of %.3g, with an average width of %.0f nucleotides and covering a total of %.3g%% of the genome, containing on average %.3g%% of reads", length(peaks), idr.threshold, mean(width(peaks)), pct.covered, mean.pct.reads))
```

```{r filter_windows_by_peak_overlap}
sexp %<>% subsetByOverlaps(peaks)
```

Lastly, we plot the resulting aveLogCPM distribution.

```{r replot_aveLogCPM}
a <- aveLogCPM(asDGEList(sexp), prior.count = 2)
p <- ggplot(data.frame(logCPM=a)) +
    aes(x=logCPM) +
    geom_histogram(aes(y=100*(..count..)/sum(..count..)), binwidth=0.1, boundary=0) +
    xlab("Average logCPM") + ylab("Percent of windows in bin") +
    coord_cartesian(xlim=quantile(a, c(0, 0.999)))
ggprint(p)
```

# Exploratory Analysis

Now we create a DGEList from the counts.

```{r prepare_dgelist}
## Extract gene metadata and colapse lists
all.window.meta <- rowRanges(sexp) %>% as.data.frame %>%
    select(-width, -strand) %>% rename(chr=seqnames)
# Convert list columns to character vectors
all.window.meta[] %<>% lapply(function(x) if (is.list(x)) sapply(x, str_c, collapse=",") else x)
rownames(all.window.meta) <- all.window.meta %$% sprintf("%s:%s-%s", chr, start, end)
dge <- asDGEList(sexp) %>% 
    assign_into(.$offset, NULL) %>%
    assign_into(.$genes, all.window.meta) %>%
    set_rownames(rownames(all.window.meta))
```

## Normalization

Normalization is a non-trivial issue for ChIP-Seq data. We will test three normalizations, one scaling normalization based on background read coverage, another based on coverage in the selected peak regions, and finally a non-linear loess-curve normalization. We also compute the number and fraction of reads in peaks for each sample.

```{r compute_norm_factors_and_frip}
# Compute these in parallel
bgnf %<-% normOffsets(bigbin.sexp, type="scaling", weighted=FALSE)
pnf %<-% normOffsets(sexp, type="scaling", weighted=TRUE)
loff %<-% { normOffsets(sexp, type="loess") + mean(getOffset(dge)) }
sample.table$BGNormFactors <- colData(sexp)$BGNormFactors <- bgnf
sample.table$PeakNormFactors <- colData(sexp)$PeakNormFactors <- pnf
assay(sexp, "offsets.loess")  <- loff

sample.table$RiP <- colData(sexp)$RiP <- assay(sexp) %>%
    colSums %>%
    divide_by(sample.table$CountDupFactor)
sample.table$FRiP <- colData(sexp)$FRiP <- colData(sexp) %$% { RiP / totals }
```

We plot both normalizations against all relevant experimental factors:

```{r plot_frip}
p <- list(ggduo(as.data.frame(colData(sexp)),
                columnsX=c("cell_type", "time_point", "donor_id", "totals", "FRiP"),
                columnsY=c("BGNormFactors", "PeakNormFactors")) + 
              labs(title="Covariates vs normalization factors"),
          ggpairs(as.data.frame(colData(sexp)[c("totals", "RiP", "FRiP", "BGNormFactors", "PeakNormFactors")])) + 
              labs(title="Normalization factors, and read totals/fractions"))
ggprint(p)
```

The strongest associations are between the FRiP values and both normalization factors, with the peak-based normalization factors being positively correlated with FRiP and the background normalization being negatively correlated. This indicates that the peak-based normalization factors are counteracting differences in pulldown efficiency between samples, while composition normalizationfactors are preserving, and perhaps even reinforcing these differences. This is the expected behavior for both normalization methods. There is also a visible, but weaker, negative correlation between total read counts and FRiP: sample with more total reads tend to have a greater fraction of reads not overlapping peaks.

To test these normalizations, we will look at their effect on the dispersion estimation step. But first, we must generate the design matrix in order to estimate dispersions.

```{r build_design_matrix}
design <- model.matrix(~0 + group, sample.table, strip.prefixes = TRUE)
colnames(design)
# Same design, but with an intercept, because sva requires it
design.int <- model.matrix(~1 + group, sample.table)
```


## SVA

To account for the variable effect of donor, efficiency bias, and as any other sources of systematic bias present in the data, we use SVA to estimate surrogate variables. We do so for each normalization method, including an additional method based on only the windows that are both peak-overlapping and have a mean count greater than 5.

```{r sva}
count.threshold <- 5
filter.threshold <- aveLogCPM(count.threshold, lib.size=mean(dge$samples$lib.size))
filt <- aveLogCPM(dge) >= filter.threshold
message(sprintf("Excluding %i out of %i peak-overlapping windows (%.3g%%) with average count below %s.",
                sum(filt == FALSE), length(filt), 100*(1-mean(filt)), count.threshold))
dgefilt <- dge[filt,]
dges <- list(
    BGNorm=dgefilt %>% assign_into(.$samples$norm.factors, colData(sexp)$BGNormFactors),
    PeakNorm=dgefilt %>% assign_into(.$samples$norm.factors, colData(sexp)$PeakNormFactors),
    PeakHANorm=dgefilt %>% calcNormFactors(),
    LoessNorm=dgefilt %>% assign_into(.$offset, assay(sexp, "offsets.loess")[filt,]))
logcpms <- lapply(dges, cpmWithOffset, prior.count=1)
# Need a design with an intercept for sva
svobjs <- bplapply(logcpms, sva, design.int)
# We are expecting at least 1 SV. If there are no SVs, then the downstream code
# needs changing.
for (i in names(svobjs)) {
    assert_that(svobjs[[i]]$n.sv > 0)
}
svmats <- lapply(svobjs, . %$% sv %>% cbind %>% add.numbered.colnames("SV"))
sv.designs <- lapply(svmats, . %>% cbind(design, .))
sv.designs.int <- lapply(svmats, . %>% cbind(design.int, .))
numsv.table <- sapply(svobjs, . %$% n.sv) %>% data_frame(NormType=names(.) , NumSV=.)
print(numsv.table)
p <- list()
for (i in names(svmats)) {
    d <- cbind(sample.table, svmats[[i]])
    p[[i]] <- ggduo(d, 
                    columnsX=c("cell_type", "time_point", "donor_id", "totals", "FRiP"),
                    columnsY=c(colnames(svmats[[i]]))) + 
        labs(title="Covariates vs surrogate variables",
             subtitle=sprintf("For SVs from %s normalization", i))
}
ggprint(p)
```

With the background normalization, we can clearly see that the first surrogate variable becomes a proxy for ChIP efficiency. This is a hint that efficiency normalization may be correct for this data set. Beyond that, it seems that some of the surrogate variables are capturing the donor effects, while others show little correlation with any known experimental factors, which is expected.

## Dispersion estimation

Now we estimate the dispersions with and without empirical Bayes shrinkage, with and without surrogate variables.

```{r estimate_disp_normtest}
dges.noebayes <- bpmapply(estimateDisp, y=dges, design=sv.designs, MoreArgs=list(prior.df=0))
dges.noebayes.nosv <- bpmapply(estimateDisp, y=dges, MoreArgs=list(design=design, prior.df=0))
dges <- bpmapply(estimateDisp, y=dges, design=sv.designs, MoreArgs=list(robust=TRUE))
dges.nosv <- bpmapply(estimateDisp, y=dges, MoreArgs=list(design=design, robust=TRUE))
# Hopefully save memory by re-sharing common parts after running in separate processes
for (i in names(dges)) {
    for (slot in c("counts", "genes")) {
        dges.noebayes[[i]][[slot]] <- 
            dges.noebayes.nosv[[i]][[slot]] <- 
            dges[[i]][[slot]] <- 
            dges.nosv[[i]][[slot]] <- 
            dgefilt[[slot]]
    }
}
xlims <- lapply(c(dges, dges.nosv), . %$% AveLogCPM %>% range) %>%
    unlist %>% range %>% expand_range(mul=0.05)
ylims <- lapply(c(dges, dges.nosv), . %$% c(quantile(tagwise.dispersion, c(0, 0.975)), trended.dispersion, common.dispersion) %>% range) %>%
    unlist %>% c(0) %>% range %>% sqrt %>% pmax(0) %>% expand_range(mul=0.05)
```

We now inspect the dispersion plot for each of the normalizations.

```{r plot_disp_normtest}
p <- list()
for (i in names(dges)) {
    prior.df <- dges[[i]]$prior.df %>% median
    p[[i]] <- ggplotBCV(dges[[i]], rawdisp=dges.noebayes[[i]]) +
        coord_cartesian(xlim = xlims, ylim=ylims, expand=FALSE) +
        labs(title=sprintf("BCV Plot with %s", i),
             subtitle=sprintf("Prior d.f. = %.3g", prior.df))
}
ggprint(p)
```

Clearly, the peak-based normalizations produce the smallest BCV estimates. This is expected because both have 9 surrogate variables in their models, while the other models have fewer. Based on these plots, we would lean toward one of the peak-based normalizations, but we can't rule out the other two.

We also inspect the BCV plot without SVA:

```{r plot_disp_normtest_nosv}
p <- list()
for (i in names(dges.nosv)) {
    prior.df <- dges.nosv[[i]]$prior.df %>% median
    p[[i]] <- ggplotBCV(dges.nosv[[i]], rawdisp=dges.noebayes.nosv[[i]]) +
        coord_cartesian(xlim = xlims, ylim=ylims, expand=FALSE) +
        labs(title=sprintf("BCV Plot with %s and no SVA", i),
             subtitle=sprintf("Prior d.f. = %.3g", prior.df))
}
ggprint(p)
```

It's clear that without SVA, the BCVs are on average much higher for each type or normalization. We can quantify this by looking at the distribution of changes in BCV when the surrogate variables are added to the model.

```{r sva_disp_effect}
disptable <- lapply(names(dges), function(i) {
    data_frame(NormType = i, Window = rownames(dges[[i]]),
               DispSVA = dges[[i]]$tagwise.dispersion,
               DispNoSVA = dges.nosv[[i]]$tagwise.dispersion)
}) %>% do.call(what = rbind) %>%
    mutate(BCV_SVA = sqrt(DispSVA), 
           BCV_NoSVA = sqrt(DispNoSVA),
           BCV_Change = BCV_SVA - BCV_NoSVA)
# This isn't used any more and takes up a lot of memory, so delete it
rm(dges.nosv, dges.noebayes, dges.noebayes.nosv); invisible(gc())
disptable %>% group_by(NormType) %>% do({
    summary(.$BCV_Change) %>% unclass %>% rbind %>% as_data_frame
}) %>% inner_join(numsv.table, ., by="NormType")
bcv_upper_limit <- disptable %>% select(BCV_SVA, BCV_NoSVA) %>% unlist %>% quantile(.999)
ggplot(disptable) + 
    aes(x=NormType, y=BCV_NoSVA) + 
    geom_violin(aes(fill=NormType), scale = "area") +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.07, fill = "grey", alpha=0.75, outlier.alpha = 0) +
    scale_fill_hue(guide="none") + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, bcv_upper_limit)) +
    labs(title="BCV estimates without SVA") + 
    xlab("Normalization Type") + 
    ylab("BCV")
ggplot(disptable) + 
    aes(x=NormType, y=BCV_SVA) + 
    geom_violin(aes(fill=NormType), scale = "area") +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.07, fill = "grey", alpha=0.75, outlier.alpha = 0) +
    scale_fill_hue(guide="none") + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim=c(0, bcv_upper_limit)) +
    labs(title="BCV estimates with SVA") + 
    xlab("Normalization Type") + 
    ylab("BCV")
ggplot(disptable) + 
    aes(x=NormType, y=BCV_Change) + 
    geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype="dashed", alpha=0.5) +
    geom_violin(aes(fill=NormType), scale = "area") +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.07, fill = "grey", alpha=0.75, outlier.alpha = 0) +
    scale_fill_hue(guide="none") + 
    coord_cartesian(ylim=quantile(disptable$BCV_Change, c(.001, .999))) +
    labs(title="Effect of SVA on BCV estimates") + 
    xlab("Normalization Type") + 
    ylab("Change in BCV with SVA")
```

We can see that the median change in BCV is about 0.15 downward for all normalizations, except for background normalization, where it is more like 0.2. This makes sense, since the first SV for the background normalization is removing an effect that was already removed by the other normalizations.

Next, we examine the effect of each normalization on the MDS plot.

## MDS Plots

We compute the MDS coordinates after subtracting the effects of the surrogate variables for each normalization. The result is a plot showing the variation attributable to sources other than those unknown batch effects. To demonstrate the difference that batch subtraction makes, we also generate the same plots from the uncorrected data.

```{r compute_mds_normtest}
bcdata <- mapply(function(dge, des) { 
    sv.cols <- colnames(des) %>% .[str_detect(., "^SV\\d+$")]
    assert_that(length(sv.cols) > 0)
    v <- voomWithOffset(dge, des)
    v$E <- suppressMessages(subtractCoefs(v$E, des, coefsToSubtract = sv.cols))
    v
}, dge=dges, des=sv.designs.int)
prep.mds <- function(x) {
    mds <- suppressPlot(plotMDS(x))
    mds.distances <- mds %$% distance.matrix %>% as.dist
    df <- mds.distances %>% 
    {suppressWarnings(cmdscale(., k=ncol(x)-1))} %>% 
        add.numbered.colnames(prefix="Dim") %>%
        as.data.frame %>%
        cbind(sample.table)
    # Use Naive D0 as the reference group, and flip the signs of each dimension
    # such that the mean of this group is negative. This makes it more likely that 
    mdscols <- colnames(df) %>% .[str_detect(., "Dim\\d+")]
    needflip <- df %>% filter(group=="NaiveD0") %>%
        .[mdscols] %>% colMeans %>% is_greater_than(0)
    for (i in mdscols[needflip]) {
        df[[i]] %<>% multiply_by(-1)
    }
    df
}
mdstabs <- bplapply(bcdata, prep.mds)
mdstabs.nosv <- bplapply(dges, prep.mds)
ggmds <- function(x) {
     ggplot(x %>% arrange(cell_type, time_point, donor_id)) +
        aes(x=Dim1, y=Dim2, label=SampleName, color=time_point,
            shape=cell_type, linetype=donor_id, group=cell_type:donor_id) +
        geom_encircle(aes(group=time_point:cell_type, color=NULL, fill=time_point), s_shape=0.75, expand=0.05, color=NA, alpha=0.2) +
        geom_path(color=hcl(c=0, l=45), aes(color=NULL)) +
        # geom_point(   size=4) +
        geom_point(aes(size=totals)) +
        scale_shape_manual(values=c(Naive=16, Memory=17)) +
        scale_fill_hue(l=55) +
        scale_linetype_manual(values=c("solid", "dashed", "dotdash", "twodash")) +
        guides(shape = guide_legend(order=1, ncol=2, override.aes = list(size=4, color=hcl(c=0, l=80), fill=hcl(c=0, l=55))),
               fill = guide_legend(order=2, ncol=2, override.aes = list(shape = 16, size=4)),
               color = guide_legend(order=2, ncol=2),
               linetype = guide_legend(order=3, ncol=2),
               size = guide_legend(order=4, title = "total_reads")) +
        coord_equal()
}
p12 <- p23 <- p12.nosv <- p23.nosv <- list()
for (i in names(mdstabs)) {
    p12[[i]] <- ggmds(mdstabs[[i]]) +
        labs(title="MDS Principal Coordinates 1 & 2",
             subtitle=sprintf("With %s normalization; SVs subtracted", i)) +
        coord_equal()
    p23[[i]] <- p12[[i]] + aes(x=Dim2, y=Dim3) +
        labs(title="MDS Principal Coordinates 2 & 3")
    p12.nosv[[i]] <- ggmds(mdstabs.nosv[[i]]) +
        labs(title="MDS Principal Coordinates 1 & 2",
             subtitle=sprintf("With %s normalization; SVs not subtracted", i)) +
        coord_equal()
    p23.nosv[[i]] <- p12.nosv[[i]] + aes(x=Dim2, y=Dim3) +
        labs(title="MDS Principal Coordinates 2 & 3")
}
```

```{r mds_pc12}
ggprint(p12)
```

```{r mds_pc23}
ggprint(p23)
```

In this case, all normalizations produce nearly the same MDS plot. This is encouraging because it means that the downstream analysis will not be substantially affected by the choice of normalization method. For convenience, we will move forward with the PeakHANorm method, which is the simplest to implement.

## MDS plots without subtracting SV effects

Now, we repeat the same plots as above, but with no subtraction of surrogate variable effects from the data.

```{r mds_pc12_NoSV}
ggprint(p12.nosv)
```

```{r mds_pc23_NoSV}
ggprint(p23.nosv)
```

Without the surrogate variables, the MDS still have some of the same features, but the groups are much less clearly separated. This underscores the importance of modelling unknown sources of variation in the data using SVA. These unknown sources could include ChIP efficiency bias, GC bias, and other technical variables in the ChIP-Seq process that have nothing to do with the biology of the experiment. Because the donor ID was not included in the design, inter-donor variability could also be included in the surrogate variables.

## Variance Partitioning analysis

To further investigate the sources of variance within the data, we can use the `variancePartition` package. We fit 4 models to the data so that we can see how the percent of variance explained changes depending on which terms are included in the model.

```{r run_vpart}
sample.table.with.sv <- cbind(sample.table, svmats$PeakHANorm)
vp.formulas <- list(Group_Only = ~group,
                    Group_and_Covars = ~ group + donor_id + FRiP,
                    Group_and_SV = as.formula(str_c(c("~ group", colnames(svmats$PeakHANorm)), collapse=" + ")),
                    Group_and_Covars_and_SV = as.formula(str_c(c("~ group + donor_id + FRiP", colnames(svmats$PeakHANorm)), collapse=" + ")))
designs <- lapply(vp.formulas, model.matrix, data=sample.table.with.sv)
elists <- bplapply(designs, voomWithOffset, dge=dges$PeakHANorm)
# Function is already parallelized, so don't call it in parallel
varParts <- mapply(function(...) try(fitExtractVarPartModel(...)), exprObj=elists, formula=vp.formulas, 
                   MoreArgs=list(data=sample.table.with.sv))
# Collapse SVs to a single column
varTables <- list()
for (i in names(varParts)) {
    if (is(varParts[[i]], "try-error")) {
        message("Could not run variancePartition for ", i, ", probably due to collinearity of covariates.")
    } else {
        assert_that(is(varParts[[i]], "varPartResults"))
        x <- as(varParts[[i]], "data.frame")
        x.sv <- x %>% select(matches("^SV\\d+$"))
        if (ncol(x.sv) > 0) {
            x.nosv <- x[setdiff(colnames(x), colnames(x.sv))]
            x <- data.frame(x.nosv, SV=rowSums(x.sv))
        }
        varTables[[i]] <- cbind(select(x, -Residuals), select(x, Residuals))
    }
}
```

The variancePartition function failed to run for the model that included both known covariates and surrogate variables. This is expected if the surrogate variables are highly correlated with any of the known covariates, which we have already observed is the case for donor ID.

```{r plot_vpart}
p <- list()
for (i in names(varTables)) {
    incl <- str_replace_all(i, "_and_", " + ")
    p[[i]] <- plotVarPart(varTables[[i]]) +
        labs(title=str_c("Variance Partitions, ", incl))
}
ggprint(p)
```

It is an encouraging sign that no matter which covariates are included, the percent of variance explained by the main experimental effects (group) stays the same. It seems that donor ID and FRiP explain only a small amount of additional variance, while the surrogate variables explain much more. This can be justified more rigorously using the Bayesian Information Criterion:

```{r selectModel}
sm <- BPselectModel(voomWithOffset(dges$PeakHANorm, designs[[1]]), designs, criterion = "bic")
as.data.frame(table(sm$pref)) %>% rename(Model=Var1)
ggplot(melt(sm$IC) %>% rename(Model=Models, Probe=Probes, IC=value)) + 
    aes(x=Model, fill=Model, y=IC) + geom_violin() +
    geom_boxplot(width = 0.07, fill = "grey", alpha=0.75, outlier.alpha = 0) +
    scale_fill_hue(guide="none") + 
    ylab("BIC") + 
    labs(title="Window BIC distribution by model",
         subtitle="(lower is better)")
ggplot(sm$IC) + aes(x=Group_and_SV, y=Group_and_Covars_and_SV) + 
    geom_point(size=0.1) + 
    geom_abline(slope=1, intercept=0, linetype = "longdash", color=muted("red", l=50, c=90)) + 
    geom_density2d() +
    coord_fixed() + 
    labs(title="Window BIC with vs. without Donor & FRiP covariates")
```

When the covariates (donor and FRiP) are added into any model, the BIC for the average gene gets larger (i.e. worse), indicating that for most windows these covariates are not explaining enough additional variation to justify including them in the model. Note that this does not mean these are unimportant covariates, but that the surrogate variables inferred by SVA are already capturing most of the variation explained by these covariates, making their inclusion mostly redundant. Looking at the scatter plot above, we can see that there is a minority of windows below the identity line for which including group and FRiP improves the model, but the majority lie above the identity line, where the no-covariates model is better.

Note that for many windows, the model with only group and no other covariates has the smallest BIC. These are likely windows that are not signifcantly affected by any covariate. Fitting the model with surrogate variables to these windows does not hurt except to sacrifice some statistical power, while it certainly gains more statistical power for the windows whose binding *is* affected by the surrogate variables.

## MA plots

Now we examine the effect of each normalization on the MA plots between samples. We will order the samples from smallest to largest ratio between the peak and background normalization factors, and then pair them up with the opposite: first with last, second with second-to-last, and so on. This will yield a range of MA plots, some between samples with very different normalizations and some with very similar normalizations.

```{r prep_ma_plots}
colData(sexp)$nf.logratio <- colData(sexp) %$% log2(PeakNormFactors/BGNormFactors)
middle.samples <- colData(sexp)$nf.logratio %>% abs %>% order
bn.higher.samples <- colData(sexp)$nf.logratio %>% order
pn.higher.samples <- rev(bn.higher.samples)

logcpm <- cpm(dgefilt, log=TRUE, prior.count=0.5)
# The same measure used for the loess normalization
AveLogCPM <- aveLogCPM(dgefilt, dispersion = 0.05, prior.count = 0.5)
logcpm.loess <- cpmWithOffset(dges$LoessNorm, log=TRUE, prior.count=0.5)
bigbin.logcpm <- cpm(asDGEList(bigbin.sexp), log=TRUE, prior.count=0.5)

getLineData <- function(s1, s2) {
    c(BG="BGNorm",
      Peaks="PeakNorm",
      PeaksHA="PeakHANorm") %>%
        sapply(. %>% {dges[[.]]$samples$norm.factors} %>% log2 %>% {.[s2] - .[s1]}) %>%
        data.frame(NormFactor=., NormType=names(.))
}

getOffsetLineData <- function(s1, s2, n=1000) {
    x <- data.frame(A=aveLogCPM(dges$LoessNorm, dispersion=0.05, prior.count=0.5),
                    Offset=dges$LoessNorm$offset %>% {.[,s2] - .[,s1]} %>% divide_by(log(2)))
    f <- approxfun(x$A, x$Offset)
    data.frame(A=seq(from=min(x$A), to=max(x$A), length.out = n)) %>%
        mutate(M=f(A))
}

doMAPlot <- function(logcpm.matrix, s1, s2, linedata=getLineData(s1, s2), curvedata=NULL,
                     AveLogCPM, Acutoff=-2) {
    pointdata <- data.frame(S1=logcpm.matrix[,s1], S2=logcpm.matrix[,s2]) %>%
        transmute(A=(S1+S2)/2, M=S2-S1)
    if (!missing(AveLogCPM)) {
        pointdata$A <- AveLogCPM
    }
    pointdata %<>% filter(A >= Acutoff)
    ## Compute bandwidth and kernel smooth surface
    H <- pointdata %>% Hbcv.diag(binned=TRUE) %>% divide_by(4)
    k <- pointdata %>%
        as.matrix %>%
        kde(gridsize=1024, bgridsize=rep(1024, 2), verbose=TRUE,
            H=H, binned=TRUE)
    ## Sometimes the estimate goes a bit negative, which is no good

    densdata <- melt(k$estimate) %>%
        transmute(
            A=k$eval.points[[1]][Var1],
            M=k$eval.points[[2]][Var2],
            Density=value %>% pmax(0),
            ## Part of a hack to make the alpha look less bad
            AlphaDens=value %>% pmax(1e-15))

    p <- ggplot(pointdata) +
        coord_fixed(ratio=1/2) +
        ## MA Plot density
        geom_raster(aes(x=A, y=M, fill=Density, alpha=AlphaDens),
                    data=densdata,
                    interpolate=TRUE) +
        scale_fill_gradientn(colors=suppressWarnings(brewer.pal(Inf, "Blues")),
                             trans=power_trans(1/8),
                             name="Density") +
        scale_alpha_continuous(trans=power_trans(1/40), guide=FALSE)
    if (!is.null(linedata) && nrow(linedata) > 0) {
        p <- p +
            ## Normalization lines
            geom_hline(data=linedata, aes(yintercept=NormFactor, color=NormType)) +
            scale_color_discrete(name="Norm Type")
    }
    if (!is.null(curvedata)) {
        p <- p + geom_line(data=curvedata, aes(x=A, y=M))
    }
    p
}
```

With the preparatory code in place, we can now make the MA plots. First, we make basic MA plots, with log difference (M) on the y-axis and the log mean (A) on the x-axis. We also plot each normalization factor as a horizontal line, indicating where that normalization method would place the zero line.

```{r maplot_windows}
p <- seq_len(floor(length(bn.higher.samples) / 2)) %>%
    lapply(function(i) {
        s1 <- bn.higher.samples[i]
        s2 <- bn.higher.samples[length(bn.higher.samples) - i + 1]
        doMAPlot(logcpm, s1, s2) +
            labs(title=sprintf("MA plot of %s windows", params$window_size),
                 subtitle=sprintf("%s vs %s", colnames(dge)[s1], colnames(dge)[s2]))
    })
ggprint(p)
```

Now, we make the same plots, but for the x-axis, we use the average log2 CPM of the whole dataset, rather than the log mean of the two samples being plotted. The advantage of this is that it uses the exact same X coordinate for every window across all the MA plots, and it also allows us to add a curve representing the loess normalization, since the loess curve is fit along the same average log2 CPM scale. The disadvantage is that this smears the plots horizontally, since windows with similar counts in the two specific samples will have different counts in all the other samples, leading to a spreading of previously similar A values, so it is not a great visualization in general. In fact, in many cases it shows where the loess normalization falls short because at some points along the x-axis, it is trying unsuccesfully to interpolate between two modes.

```{r maplot_windows_Acommon}
p <- seq_len(floor(length(bn.higher.samples) / 2)) %>%
    lapply(function(i) {
        s1 <- bn.higher.samples[i]
        s2 <- bn.higher.samples[length(bn.higher.samples) - i + 1]
        doMAPlot(logcpm, s1, s2, AveLogCPM=AveLogCPM,
                 curvedata=getOffsetLineData(s1, s2)) +
            labs(title=sprintf("MA plot of %s windows with common A scale", params$window_size),
                 subtitle=sprintf("%s vs %s", colnames(dge)[s1], colnames(dge)[s2]))
    })
ggprint(p)
```

Next, instead of plotting the loess normalization line, we make the MA plot using loess-normalized log2 CPM values. If the loess normalization is appropriate, this should center each entire plot vertically on M = 0, using the loess normalization trend as a guide.

```{r maplot_windows_loess_norm}
p <- seq_len(floor(length(bn.higher.samples) / 2)) %>%
    lapply(function(i) {
        s1 <- bn.higher.samples[i]
        s2 <- bn.higher.samples[length(bn.higher.samples) - i + 1]
        doMAPlot(logcpm.loess, s1, s2, linedata = NULL) +
            geom_hline(yintercept=0) + 
            labs(title=sprintf("MA plot of %s windows, loess normalized", params$window_size),
                 subtitle=sprintf("%s vs %s", colnames(dge)[s1], colnames(dge)[s2]))
    })
ggprint(p)
```

Next, we make the same MA plots using the same corrected data that was used to generate the MDS plots above. This data has been normalized using the peak-based factors and then had surrogate variable effects subtracted out, hopefully leaving only the biologically relevant variation. Since this data should already be normalized, we simply put a horizaontal line at zero for reference.

```{r maplot_sva}
p <- seq_len(floor(length(bn.higher.samples) / 2)) %>%
    lapply(function(i) {
        s1 <- bn.higher.samples[i]
        s2 <- bn.higher.samples[length(bn.higher.samples) - i + 1]
        doMAPlot(bcdata$PeakHANorm$E, s1, s2, linedata = NULL) +
            geom_hline(yintercept=0) + 
            labs(title=sprintf("MA plot of %s windows, peak-normalized & SVA-corrected", params$window_size),
                 subtitle=sprintf("%s vs %s", colnames(dge)[s1], colnames(dge)[s2]))
    })
ggprint(p)
```

Last, we make MA plots for the 10kb bins that were used to compute the background normalization. The main purpose of these plots is to show that the distribution of abundances is generally bimodal, with a high-abundance mode representing peak-overlapping windows and a low-abundance mode representing non-peak windows. The background normalization line passes through the low-abundance mode, while the peak-based normalizations pass through the high-abundance mode. Any difference between them is presumbed to be due to differences in either ChIP efficiency or global changes in the histone mark.

```{r maplot_bigbins}
p <- seq_len(floor(length(bn.higher.samples) / 2)) %>%
    lapply(function(i) {
        s1 <- bn.higher.samples[i]
        s2 <- bn.higher.samples[length(bn.higher.samples) - i + 1]
        doMAPlot(bigbin.logcpm, s1, s2) +
            labs(title=sprintf("MA plot of %s bins", params$bigbin_size),
                 subtitle=sprintf("%s vs %s", colnames(dge)[s1], colnames(dge)[s2]))
    })
ggprint(p)
```

These plots seem to show that some samples have significant efficiency biases, visible as a trend in the MA plot. This further supports the choice of high-abundance peak-overlapping windows for normalization, as well as our choice to regress out systematic variation using SVA, since a single scaling normalization is insufficient to remove this trend, as is a single loess curve.
